Write a query to get the list of users who took a training lesson more than once in the same day, grouped by user and training lesson, each ordered from the most recent lesson date to oldest date.


## Task 2 - Linux
How would you:
- SSH into a server with IP 12.34.56.78, user "ec2-user" and identity file "MyPrivateKey.key"
- Go to folder "/var/logs"
- Show on console the latest 30 lines of the file "super-app.log"


## Task 3 - Automated end-to-end web testing
With a test automation framework of your choice, test [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org)'s search feature by searching for "Voyager 1". We've already evaluated your test case generation skills on a previous task, so there's no need to implement more than just the specified user flow.

You can use whatever language you desire (we use Js + Mocha + Cypress/Selenium). Use as many features as you want of the testing framework, use as many patterns you want to. The required reporting is console output, but having a nicer reporting is a plus. The cleaner the code, the better.

Weâ€™ll evaluate your programming skills and web automation skills.

## Bonus task - Automated end-to-end mobile testing
This task is not mandatory, but its delivery means bonus points.

You are requested to do the same thing as of task #3 but on the mobile app of Wikipedia. Android or iOS, either is fine (you can test both if you like). As for task #3, framework's choice is free (we use Js + Mocha + WebdriverIO with Appium).

## Deliverable
Please, provide a GitHub repo/cloud folder with the solutions to the tasks and instructions on how to run the tests.

Good luck!
